    <div class="lg:mx-72 mx-10 lg:mt-12 mt-8">With seven UNESCO World Heritage sites and jaw-dropping historical destinations, no matter
        where you go in
        Egypt, you are bound to find history bursting at the seams! There’s so much more to see than just pyramids, so

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl text-blue-800">Explore Ancient Egyptian Wonders</p>
        <div class="lg:mt-10 mt-5">Ancient Egypt is famous for being the cradle of civilization, and for a good reason. It’s
            among the oldest
            and greatest civilizations. Ancient Egyptians cultivated an innovative and integrated culture on the banks
            of the Nile Valley. They developed grain farming, a sophisticated system of political organization,
            religion, writing, record-keeping, and a foundation for art to flourish. Ancient Egyptian civilization has
            shined worldwide through millennia with iconic historical figures, from Akhenaten to Queen Hatshepsut and
            from Tutankhamun to Ramesses II. The rest, as they say, is history!

        <div class="lg:mt-10 mt-5">As extraordinary as it was, ancient Egyptian civilization was only the beginning of
            history-making in the Nile Valley. Egypt also played an important cultural and political role in the
            Graeco-Roman world. Alexander the Great’s arrival to Egypt in 332 BC marked the beginning of the
            Graeco-Roman period, during which Egypt was home to such legendary figures as Queen Cleopatra

        <div class="lg:mt-10 mt-5">Christianity was brought to Egypt by the Apostle Saint Mark, early in the first century,
            making the Egyptian Coptic Church one of the oldest churches in existence.

            Today, visitors can still visit many of monasteries, such as the Monasteries of St Anthony and St Paul in
            the Red Sea and the Red and White Monasteries in Suhag. They can also walk in the footsteps of the Holy
            Family in Egypt by visiting the sites that were blessed by the Virgin Mary, the infant Jesus, and Joseph
            during their three-and-a-half-year journey through Egypt seeking sanctuary and protection.

        <div class="lg:mt-10 mt-5">The arrival of Islam to Egypt heralded Egypt’s role as an important player in the medieval
            world. Between 641 and 1517, a number of Arab-Islamic dynasties made Egypt a vital political and cultural
            center. During the Islamic Period, dynasties like the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Ayyubids, and Mamluks
            left behind a wealth of Medieval Islamic architecture, transforming Cairo into the “City of a Thousand
            Minarets.” The Mamluks were followed by nearly 400 years of Ottoman rule, as Egypt became one of the most
            important provinces of the Ottoman Empire.

            The Muhammad Ali dynasty marked the birth of the modern state of Egypt. Beginning in 1805, Muhammad Ali
            presided over the building of an impressive modern administrative system that included the world’s earliest
            modern postal services, railroad infrastructure, irrigation networks, conscription armies, manufacturing,
            education, and cultural affairs.

            His Excellency Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been the President of Egypt since 2014. During his time in office,
            he has overseen a boom in the expansion and modernization of Egypt’s infrastructure across multiple sectors
            nationwide. The government has spearheaded significant investment to modernize the country’s transportation
            infrastructure, including roads and bridges, railways, metro and electric railways, sea ports, river
            transport, land and dry ports, and logistics centers. Cairo International Airport and two other Egyptian
            airports topped the list issued by the Airports Council International (ACI) of the ten leading African
            airports in terms of passenger traffic. Eleven Egyptian airports obtained and renewed their certificates for
            safe health travel from the ACI. In addition to revamping existing airports, Egypt is also building new
            airports, such as Sphinx International Airport west of Cairo and the New Capital Airport in Egypt’s New
            Administrative Capital City.

            With an eye on the future, Egypt is developing new urban communities and holiday destinations, like
            Al-Galala, the New Administrative Capital City, New Alamein City, New Aswan, and New Mansura that will
            attract both domestic and international tourists.

            The tourism and antiquities sectors have received unprecedented support from the President, which has
            allowed the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities to inaugurate new museums and restore over 100
            archaeological sites, including mosques, churches, and synagogues. The Ministry has also been able to
            continue with its ongoing conservation and preservation of Egypt’s archaeological treasures. New
            archaeological discoveries continue to make international headlines and garner recognition as some of the
            most important archaeological discoveries in the world.
