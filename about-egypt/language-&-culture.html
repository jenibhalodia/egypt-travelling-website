        <p class="font-bold text-2xl text-blue-800">Egypt’s People Are Its Greatest Treasure</p>
        <div class="mt-5">Arabic is the official language of Egypt, spoken by the entire population of over 100 million
            citizens. In urban centers and popular tourist destinations, many Egyptians understand and are fluent in
            English. In tourist areas, other European languages—such as French, Russian, Ukrainian, Spanish, and
            Italian—are also commonly spoken.
        </div>
        <div class="mt-5">Regardless of what language Egyptians speak, the language closest to their heart is laughter.
            Egyptian culture is known for its love of humor and linguistic playfulness, and you will notice that even
            the simplest interactions will leave you smiling with friendly wit and banter.
        </div>

        <p class="font-bold text-2xl text-blue-800 mt-5">Rich in Religious Tradition</p>
        <div class="mt-5">Egypt’s Muslims and Christians have been living side by side and coexisting peacefully over
            the centuries. Muslim holidays, such as the celebration of Eid twice a year, and Coptic Christian holidays,
            such as Coptic Easter and Coptic Christmas, are large festivities celebrated with family, loved ones, and
            special food. Egyptians share a reverence for community and family, with close-knit and warm relationships
            being the norm.

        <div class="mt-5">Egyptians love to talk, eat, and stay up late together. If you are looking for a travel
            experience that will enrich your life with genuine human connections and laughter, Egypt is the place to go!
            Perhaps owing to Egypt’s young population, with around 60% of Egyptians under 30, it is common to find
            Egyptians staying up late enjoying conversation or the latest football match over a shared meal or several
            rounds of tea. In Egypt, you will experience genuine hospitality and make lifelong friendships fast, usually
            revolving around a memorable meal or two...or maybe even three!
        </div>
        <div class="mt-5">Egyptian cuisine will most certainly not disappoint. Egyptian cuisine has plenty of vegan and
            pescatarian recipes that have been tried, tested, and developed through the ages, but an innovative culinary
            scene means you can go on food tours to sample a variety of tempting dishes in diverse settings, both
            traditional and upscale. Most hotels serve international cuisine alongside Egyptian dishes. Present-day
            Egypt is also known for being the cultural hub of the Arab world with a vast production of art, music, film,
            and a lively visual and performative arts scene—so after your meal, make sure to look up <strong
