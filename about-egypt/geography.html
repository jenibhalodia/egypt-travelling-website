        <div class="mt-5">Located in the northeast corner of Africa and the southwest corner of Asia, Egypt connects the
            two continents through the Sinai Peninsula, which acts as a land bridge.
        </div>
        <div class="mt-5">The ancient Greeks called Egypt the<strong> “Gift of the Nile” </strong>as it remained one of
            the region’s major food
            producers for thousands of years. The Nile River crosses Egypt’s desert plateau, flowing from the
            southernmost borders of the country all the way through the Delta to the Mediterranean. Beyond the striking
            contrast of riverbed and desert expanse lie picturesque desert oases, colorful mountain ranges, and a
            diverse coastline.</div>
        <div class="mt-5">Exploring Egypt’s rich landscape is the perfect way to connect with nature. You can enjoy

        <div class="mt-5">Egypt’s climate is temperate with short seasonal transitions, and its moderate winter extends from November
            to April and summer from May to October. In the Nile Valley, winters are cool and mild, with certain regions
            in the south remaining warm year-round, and summers are hot and dry with cooler, more humid weather on the
            Mediterranean coastline and less humidity on the Red Sea coastline. Almost every day is a sunny day in
            Egypt, with average daylight ranging between 10 and 14 hours, depending on the time of year.</div>
