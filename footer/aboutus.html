        The Egyptian Tourism Authority (ETA) was established in 1981—by Presidential Decree No. 134—as a regulatory body
        affiliated with the Ministry of Tourism. ETA’s mission is to boost international tourism by promoting Egypt’s
        rich history and civilization and highlighting the country’s abundance of diverse tourist attractions. Part of
        ETA’s mandate is to also address any obstacles that may stand in the way of growth in Egypt’s tourism sector. It
        also aims to promote domestic tourism, raise tourism awareness throughout the country, and strengthen the
        connection between Egyptians and their heritage.
